# Map Reduce - Distributed Systems
When the code is run in hadoop, it is run by providing the jar and also the Class that is executed. The assumption is that hadoop is installed and configured, and the program is run from the directory where hadoop is installed.

# Executing the code, viewing the output:
Following is one options to run the jar/java program in hadoop, and the output that each one produces. Note the lines that are visible and hidden in each output as per the classification. 

Executing MapReduce and expecting an output that is OK for someone with access to the lines with Classification Markings AdasEngine and any lesser classification including unmarked lines:

bin/hadoop jar /Data/hadooptest/DocClassify.jar DocClassifyAdasEngine input/ output/

OUTPUT:
AdasEngine	 She walks in beauty, like the nigh
AdasEngine	 And on that cheek, and oâ€™er that brow
AdasEngine	 A mind at peace with all below
AdasEngine	 Thus mellowed to that tender light
AdasEngine	 Which waves in every raven tress
